# SharpStorm

Storm-like implementation in C#.

Work in Progress

## Inception

After my implementation [SimpleStorm](https://github.com/ajlopez/SimpleStorm) in JavaScript/Node.js, I want to explore the use
of multithreads and distributed messages. Instead of having an schema for input and output
tuples, I want to have dynamic ones. I would like to use JSON as initial serialization format for messages, although
I could use a binary format.
